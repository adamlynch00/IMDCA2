                            <h5>2nd Year Project</h5>
                            <p>A group project consisting of 2 members had to
                                develop and design a website of their choosing and implement 
                            appropriate functionality. Me and my partner decided to create a 
                                website for students which contained a Calculator, Calender, Forums page,
                                and much more. The whole idea behind this project was to create somthing
                                that would be consistently used by students throughout there college career. </p>
                                <br>
                                <h5>3rd Year Project</h5>
                                <p>
                                    A group project consisting of 4 members had to
                                    develop a website with the theme of prescription
                                    glasses. The website contained multiple
                                    functionalities which each member of the group
                                    contributed to. The main functionalities in which I     
                                    contributed was the booking system where users
                                    could view appointment slots through a calendar
                                    then book an appointment, Logging in using google
                                    and Facebook and a reviews page which allowed the
                                    user to edit, update and delete their reviews.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <h5>4th Year Project</h5>
                                <p>
                                    This project is a solo project and is the most important
                                    project of our college career as it is our final project. 
                                    For this project I decided to create a mobiles Fitness application using
                                    Node.js and android studios. I decided to create this app as fitness is somthing I am
                                    extremely interested in and felt this app would benefit me greatly.

            <p>I began working When I was 16 and have worked ever since. In my years of working
                I have gained a huge amount of experience in many different roles.

            <p>When I was 16 I got a job in a pub whilst I was still in school
                Here I worked as a lounge boy and my job was to serve customers,
                and make sure the pub floor was running smoothly.

                <p>
                    Working in retail meant I had to be loyal and
                    trustworthy as I was handling the customers money. I
                    also had to be reliable as the company relied on me
                    to show up to work on time and trust me that I would
                    do my job correctly.

                    For my college internship I worked with AIB as part of
their infrastrcutre section. In this section I worked as
part of the Oracle team. As part of this team I
contributed to many projects such as back up and
recovery phase 1 and 2. For these projects I worked as
part of a team and needed to attend weekly meetings
and standups to show how I was progressing with my
work. As part of AIB I also completed multiple solo
tasks.
